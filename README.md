# ethical-mitm-arp-spoofing-lab
In this exercise, I:Performed ARP spoofing to position my machine between the victim and the gateway, then monitored the intercepted traffic flow.Observed how, when a test user logged into an intentionally insecure demo website over HTTP, their username and password appeared in cleartext in the captured packets.Analyzed these packets to understand how attackers can harvest credentials and why using HTTPS, strong encryption and secure configurations is critical to protect users.
